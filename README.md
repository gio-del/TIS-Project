# Technologies for Information Systems Project

This repository contains a project made for the Techonologies for Information Systems course.

The project consisted in the implementation of a bias-mitigation method (Resampling) on a machine learning model in order to correct the bias it presented when working with a given dataset. 

The repo contains the following files: 

- diabetes.csv: the dataset used to train and test the machine learning model
- healthcare.ipynb: the notebook containing the code
- requirements.txt: the required python modules
