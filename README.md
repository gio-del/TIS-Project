# Technologies for Information Systems Project

This repository contains a project made for the Techonologies for Information Systems course.

The project consisted in the implementation of a bias-mitigation method (Resampling) on a machine learning model in order to correct the bias it presented when working with a given dataset. 

The repo contains the following files: 

- diabetes.csv: the dataset used to train and test the machine learning model
- healthcare.ipynb: the notebook containing the code
- requirements.txt: the required python modules

The function used in the code to apply the Resampling technique can be found in the following Repository: [DALEX](https://github.com/ModelOriented/DALEX/)

The documentation for the function can be found [here](https://dalex.drwhy.ai/python/api/fairness/index.html)

The technique that the Repository implements has been taken from the following paper: [Data preprocessing techniques for classification
without discrimination](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10115-011-0463-8.pdf)
